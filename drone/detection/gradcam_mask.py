class SaliencyMaskDropout(nn.Module):
    r'''
        This will mask out an input tensor that can have arbitrary channels. It can also return the 
        binary mask it created from the saliency map. If it is used inline in a network, scale_map
        should be set to True. 
        
        Parameters
       
           keep_percent:         A scalar from 0 to 1. This represents what percent of the image to keep. 
           return_layer_only:    Tells us to just return the masked tensor only. Useful for putting layer into an nn.sequental. 
           scale_map:            Scale the output like we would a dropout layer?
           
        Will return
        
            (1) The maksed tensor.
            (2) The mask by itself.

            We will create the saliency mask but we use torch.autograd so that we can optionally
